For a trend like current, there needs to be "Sell at pnl %"

Had done half grid search
Test all working.

Have a manual logic consisten enough in backtest in daddy bot backtest.

Have a proper backtest of altcoin and ratio with changing parameter, rebalancing and all every 3 months including liquidation. Then try 1,2,3,4 month and none.
Rebalance by closing all positions?

Then combine all to create allocation. Find withdawls. I am thinking no withdrawls till end of daddy.
