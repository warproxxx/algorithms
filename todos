There is an extra in altcoin bot and ratio too. In the chart at least.

Need to add liquidations

Altcoin unifier:
1) First store all df in csv.
2) Then get the ones containing first 3 month. test them at 10% per month return threshold
3) Select the pairs that did good.
4) Maximize them. Find allocation
5) Use the allocation on next 3 month and save as first backtest

And so on.

Have a manual logic consisten enough in backtest in daddy bot backtest.



Have a proper backtest of altcoin and ratio with changing parameter, rebalancing and all every 3 months including liquidation. Then try 1,2,3,4 month and none.
Rebalance by closing all positions?

Then combine all to create allocation. Find withdawls. I am thinking no withdrawls till end of daddy.
